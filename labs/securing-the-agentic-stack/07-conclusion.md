## What you did to one application

| Stage | The catalog | What you could prove |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| An agent built it | Whatever base it chose | Nothing |
| Lab 1 | + vocabulary | What is in it, and which findings matter |
| Lab 2 | Hardened base | All three questions, inherited from the base |
| Lab 3 | + build attestations, + a gate | That it stays true |
| Lab 4 | + a sandbox and the DHI MCP server | The agent starts from trusted inputs |

Nothing about the application changed. The source is identical. What changed is how much
of it you can account for.

---

## Run the agent again

Same agent. Same prompt. One difference: this time it has rails — a hardened base pinned
in its instructions and the Lab 3 policy gate live in the pipeline. It produces something
that passes on the first attempt.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the point of the entire session.
>
> You did not slow the agent down, take away its autonomy, or add a human review step
> back into the loop. You made the fast path and the safe path the same path.
>
> The agent was never the problem. The absence of verifiable evidence was.

## Your security framework

1. **Know what is in your images** — SBOM and VEX
2. **Verify where they came from** — SLSA provenance and signatures
3. **Start from a trusted base** — hardened images
4. **Enforce at the pipeline** — build policies that fail closed
5. **Sandbox your agents** — run them in a microVM, governed by policy, with only signed tools reachable

## One last check

```bash terminal-id=build
docker images catalog-service
```

Two images, same source. One you can prove things about.
